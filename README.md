# Location Inc Test Code - Full Stack

This repositiory creates the full YEOMAN/MEAN stack for the Location Inc Test.    

This was inteneded to run on your desktop using Node and Grunt to serve this up.  If you have Grunt and Node installed on your Computer, you should be able to clone this repo and then browse to it in your terminal and run the commannd <i> grunt serve </i> and that should fire off the application on localhost:9000

The App folder contains the Angular Code that Ryan developed for this test, as the rest of the code is boilerplate stuff that Yeoman generated for me.  The "support" code could be cleaned up, as I built in more components than I needed for this example.   

Again, the mail folder that contains my code is the app folder, which contains the controller and view code for this SPA. 

Google Maps was used as the Map API for this, as Angular has a nice API that ties into Google maps that I leveraged.  

A "live" demo of the code can be found at <a href="http://massachusettswebdesigns.com/MapTest/app/#/"> http://massachusettswebdesigns.com/MapTest/app/#/ </a>

The Live version is basically the same as what you see here, with only a few path names changed due to some issues I had with the relative paths conflicting - the logic has not changed.
